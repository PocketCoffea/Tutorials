# Variations

Systematic variations are usually Weights variations or Shape variations: 

- Weight variations: just different weights that are applied alternatively when filling histograms
- Shape variations: variations of the object calibrations which make necessary to rerun multiple times the analysis
  workflow on varied collections. 
  
## Weight variations

In PocketCoffea Weights can have variations: either just an up/down single variation, or multiple named variations. 
Have a look at the previous step of the tutorial [Weights](../4_Weights) for more details. 

The variations to include in the histogram outputs are specified by sample and by category with a dictionary in the
configuration file.
